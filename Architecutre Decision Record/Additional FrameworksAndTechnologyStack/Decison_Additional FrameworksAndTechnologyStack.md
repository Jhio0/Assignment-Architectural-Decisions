Decision 6: Additional Frameworks and Technology Stacks 

Status: Accepted 

Decision: In our tech stack, we have embraced Firebase as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) solution for push notifications, user analytics, and real-time database functionality. 

Justification: 

Push Notifications: Leveraging Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) streamlines our push notification implementation and guarantees dependable delivery to both iOS and Android devices (https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging). This decision not only simplifies our development process but also ensures that critical information reaches users effectively and in a timely manner, enhancing their engagement with the application. 

Real-time Features: The adoption of Firebase Realtime Database enables real-time synchronization of app data, a pivotal requirement for functionalities like order updates (https://firebase.google.com/docs/database).This technology empowers us to deliver dynamic, up-to-the-minute information to users, fostering a more interactive and engaging user experience
