Decision : App  Type - Native 

Status: Accepted 

Decision: We have decided to develop a native mobile app for both iOS and Android platforms. 

Justification: 

Performance and User Experience: Native apps outshine web and hybrid counterparts by offering top-notch performance and user experience, courtesy of their in-depth integration with platform-specific APIs and capabilities. Their purpose-built nature allows them to fully exploit the device's hardware and software, resulting in optimized performance, snappy responsiveness, and direct access to device features like the camera, GPS, and accelerometer. This integration enables native apps to craft tailored and unique experiences, setting them apart and ensuring user satisfaction.(https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/,https://developer.android.com/guide) 

Access to Platform Features: Native development provides access to platform-specific features, ensuring a seamless integration of functions like in-app payments and hardware-specific interactions.
