Decision 3: Backend Language 

Status: Accepted 

Decision: We have opted to employ Node.js for server-side logic and Python for data processing and analytics. 

Justification: 

Real-time Features: Node.js, with its event-driven, non-blocking architecture, is our choice for handling real-time features like push notifications and online-offline synchronization (https://nodejs.org/en/docs).This architecture ensures the efficient handling of concurrent connections and is well-suited for applications that require instant updates and communication with minimal latency. 

Data Processing: Python, renowned for its rich ecosystem of libraries, is the ideal choice for data processing and analytics (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html).Its extensive selection of tools for data manipulation and statistical analysis equips us to manage and analyze data effectively, essential for meeting the demands of our application. This combination of Node.js and Python ensures a well-rounded backend setup tailored to our specific requirements.
