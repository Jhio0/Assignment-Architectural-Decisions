Decision 5: Data Storage 

Status: Accepted 

Decision: Our chosen strategy involves utilizing local storage to facilitate offline access and Amazon S3 for data synchronization when an internet connection becomes available. 

Justification: 

Offline Access: The use of local storage is instrumental in providing users with uninterrupted access to essential data, even in offline mode. This ensures a seamless and consistent browsing experience, enhancing user satisfaction (https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage). 

Data Synchronization: The selection of Amazon S3 as our cloud storage solution is grounded in its reputation for reliability and scalability. It guarantees secure and efficient data synchronization, safeguarding data integrity and consistency across devices (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).This approach supports the user in keeping their information up to date and readily accessible when they move between online and offline environments, thereby contributing to a robust and reliable user experience.
