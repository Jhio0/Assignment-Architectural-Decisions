Decision 2: UI Framework 

Status: Accepted 

Decision: We have chosen to implement our user interface using platform-specific UI frameworks: UIKit for iOS and Android's native UI framework. 

Justification: 

Consistency and Familiarity: Platform-specific UI frameworks offer users a consistent and familiar interface, enhancing their experience. This approach aligns with platform design guidelines, ensuring users feel comfortable with the app's appearance and navigation.(https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/theming/look-and-feel) 

Optimized UI Performance: Utilizing native UI components ensures efficient rendering and smooth interactions, minimizing lag. This approach prioritizes a responsive and high-performing user experience, even under heavy usage or resource-intensive tasks.
